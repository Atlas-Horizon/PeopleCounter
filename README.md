# PeopleCounter

## Background and Motivation:

In response to social distancing measures during COVID-19 pandemic, it has been imposed to limit the number of people in almost every location and educational institutions are not exempted to it. Hence the idea of counting the actual number of people inside the building became a requirement.

On each of library entrances (where I currently work), there are counters at the gate that logs each entry and exits. From these logs, reports are generated on a regular basis (monthly). However, this solution does not provide a live counter that can be viewed and monitored on a near real-time basis.
