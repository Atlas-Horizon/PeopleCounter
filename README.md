# PeopleCounter

## Background and Motivation:

In response to social distancing measures during COVID-19 pandemic, it has been imposed to limit the number of people in almost every location and educational institutions are not exempted to it. Hence the idea of counting the actual number of people inside the building became a requirement.

On each of library entrances (where I currently work), there are counters at the gate that logs each entry and exits. From these logs, reports are generated on a regular basis (monthly). However, this solution does not provide a live counter that can be viewed and monitored on a near real-time basis.
<br />

## The idea

Despite of having a simple requirement, I realized that none of the vendors we have can provide exactly what need. Not to mention the very high cost that comes with the solution.

In this regard, we decided to create our own solution. After checking our gate counters, I realized that there's a configuration to send the current count to a server via HTTP, however is it not being utilized. We played around the newly found feature/setting and set it to send update every 1 second to emulate near real-time couting.

<br />

## How it works:

Re-configurations are made to the entrancesâ€™ people counters to send update to a server every few seconds. From the server, the information is parsed, and calculations are made for the occupancy count. The information is then displayed in a browser that refreshes every few seconds as shown below:

</p>

Historical data are then saved on a Database and then displayed using Dash by Plotly module. Using heatmap chart on a daily and hourly basis we're be able to see the occupancy trends across several days.
